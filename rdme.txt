I wont even bother the Eclipse or other IDE users.
For those who use the Command line interface, follow this:
*)Store files clientA.java, fr1.java, frup.java, frdw.java in a folder, named "p"(package name)
*)use the terminal to travel to the folder p.
*) in p, type this command :
	javac -cp . clientA.java fr1.java frup.java frdw.java
*)Now travel to the parent directory of p (using cd ..)
*) After the compilation is successful; In a separate terminal, complie the server, with javac hell.java
*)Then boot the server by typing java hell
*)Now run the fr1, by typing java fr1
